Hi Elton,

My manager liked your profile and would like to move you to the next step which is to have you complete the coding challenge. You will find instructions below with additional information.

In order to submit you for the role, this must be completed and you must send me the GitHub Link with the files pushed into a repository. 

Following directors is VERY important to this role and they have already disqualified someone based on their inability to follow directions. 

Please make sure you push each exercise as a file, into GitHub separately. 

And make sure you do testing for each of the exercises separately 

and send as a separate file to the GitHub. 

One of the big qualifications pieces for this manager are the testing skills (& following instructions). 

You must provide testing for each exercise and you must include instructions on how to run the tests, for each exercise. 

Please let me know if you have any questions!
 
Challenge:
We are big fans of http://adventofcode.com/2016. 

PLEASE copy and paste this link into a web browser and make sure the page you are completing exercises off of are for 2016. It will display the year in the top left corner. 

Your assignment (should you choose to accept it) is to solve exercises number 1, 4 & 10. 

Question 1 has 2 parts and you can solve both parts in the same file. This goes the same for any other exercises that may have multiple parts.

Each exercise has two parts, in order to do reach the second part you have to solve correctly the first part.

Please make sure of the following:
* Push your solution to a repository in github
* Use the language you feel more comfortable with (feel free to check with us).
* Please solve each exercise in a separate file. 
* You have to include tests and be thorough. The test for each exercise should also be in a separate file. Extra points for using a properties testing or a generative testing framework
* We also like functional programming, more extra points for using functional programming concepts.
* Please include a README on how to run the tests in case we are not familiar with the ecosystem of your choice.
* Be as clear as possible. If you need to add extra comments feel free to do so.
 
The timeline is one week (flexible). Any questions feel free to task. 

Feedback from previous candidates who did not pass:
The manager pointed out that the directions were not followed as the tests were basically empty, there was no script to run from command line and the code was not clear. He also mentioned that the style was very junior in terms of: 
- There is no clear design or separation of concerns.
- The algorithms are messy and lack abstractions
